~~This is not assigned reading~~ *, just one of probably many posts I'll make that in someways relate to our class.  A really great dude [Paul Ford](https://twitter.com/ftrain) wrote it and you should check out other stuff he writes/does/tweets too. 

Longer read but very worth it I think. 


##### *just kidding, this is now assigned reading as I mentioned in class and in my email.
