We looked at three examples based on Arduino hardware, the Arduino IDE and some common components which can be found [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sik-experiment-guide-for-arduino---v32) with great detail and more examples. We looked at examples 1, 2 and 4 in class. 

Reminder that you can recreate all of these examples and tons more for FREE and without any hardware thanks to [123d.circuits.io](https://123d.circuits.io). I recreated the first example for reference:

And a great introduction to Arduino is available [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-an-arduino) that may answer any questions concerning details I may have glossed over due to time. The specific board I was using in class is the [UNO](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11021). As always please feel free to ask any questions you may be left with.
