In class I demonstrated some of my self-taught soldering techniques but if you were curious if your wire splicing is up to NASA standards please see this informative diagram below. This is commonly known as a Lineman's splice. 

![NASA](/img/nasa.png "NASA")

- The conductors shall be pre-tinned.
- There shall be at least 3 turns around each conductor and the wraps shall be tight with no gaps between adjacent turns.
- The wraps shall not overlap and the ends of the wrap shall be trimmed flush prior to soldering to prevent protruding ends.
- Conductors shall not overlap the insulation of the other wire.
