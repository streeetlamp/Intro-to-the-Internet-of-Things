      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, this little site will be serving as a central repository for the course. That includes any assignments, resources, syllabus, discussions and sporadic posts of interesting or inspiring links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find a list of resources in the menu to the right -&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All posts have comments enabled below \/, any comments made count towards class participation the same as in class discussions do. Assigned readings will be announced in class and posted here and it is required to post a brief comment on these. Comments at a minimum only need to be a sentence or two and can be a question about the material, any insights gained, replying to another comment or just quick thoughts on the subject. Also please use a Disqus username that allows me to know who is who.&lt;/p&gt;
